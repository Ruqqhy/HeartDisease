# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning can be applied to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical and lifestyle data. Leveraging a dataset that includes key risk factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, this project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can support early diagnosis and preventive care in cardiovascular health.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Accurate and timely prediction can significantly reduce mortality rates and improve patient outcomes. In recent years, the integration of machine learning into healthcare has opened new possibilities for automating and improving clinical decision-making.

This project applies supervised learning techniques to a labeled heart disease dataset to:

* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights and trends
* Develop and evaluate **classification models** for disease prediction
* Identify the most important features contributing to heart disease

## 🎯 Objectives

* Improve understanding of the relationships between medical features and heart disease
* Build predictive models to assess the risk of heart disease
* Support clinical decision-making through interpretable machine learning
* Gain hands-on experience in healthcare data analysis

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following medical and demographic attributes:

* Age
* Sex
* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol level
* Fasting blood sugar
* Maximum heart rate achieved
* Chest pain type

* Target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved:

* Identifying data distributions and correlations
* Detecting outliers and data imbalances
* Visualizing relationships between risk factors and heart disease occurrence

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

* Logistic Regression was used to train and evaluate the model



### 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision & Recall



## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis
